# Project Overview

- This is a Python 3.11+ project implementing Piecewise Specialist Symbolic Regression (PSSR) using Genetic Programming techniques. 

- What I am trying to do here is to reimplement my old library using a faster sk-learn based implementation, with fit, predict methods. The library is called slim_gsgp_lib_np. 

- PSSR corresponds to the MULTI_SLIM approach. I dont need to implement SLIM_GSGP for this work. 

## Domain Context

- This project deals with symbolic regression and genetic programming
- Performance is important - vectorized operations are preferred
- Benchmarking code is included in the codebase

## Dependencies

- numpy >= 2.3.4
- scikit-learn >= 1.7.2
- pytest >= 9.0.1
- ruff >= 0.14.5
- black >= 25.11.0
