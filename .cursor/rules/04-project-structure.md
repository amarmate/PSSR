# Project Structure

## File Organization

- Source code is in `src/pssr/`
- Tests are in `tests/`
- Use absolute imports always (e.g., `from core.misc import ...`)
- Keep `__init__.py` files minimal (unused imports allowed)

## Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized (complexity ≤ 15)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
